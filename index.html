    <h1>Welcome to my GitHub tutorial website!</h1>
    <p>This website will teach you the basics of using GitHub for collaboration.</p>
    <p>GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development projects. A repository, or "repo" for short, is a collection of files and directories that represent a project, and can be hosted on GitHub.</p>
    <p>There are several collaboration practices employed by different organizations on GitHub. Some of the most common practices include:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Fork and pull request:</b> In this model, a user creates a fork of a project's repository, makes their changes, and then submits a pull request to the original repository owner. The owner can then review the changes and either accept or reject them. This model is often used for open-source projects where contributions from the community are encouraged.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>Branching model:</b> In this model, developers create their own branches off the main codebase and work on their changes there. Once the changes are complete, they submit a pull request to the main codebase, and the changes are merged in. This model is commonly used for larger projects with multiple developers working on different features simultaneously.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>Centralized workflow:</b> In this model, one central repository is used as the main codebase, and all developers have read and write access to it. Changes are made directly to the main codebase, and code reviews are conducted before merging changes in. This model is often used for smaller projects with fewer developers.
